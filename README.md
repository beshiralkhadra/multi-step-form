## **Usage**

Running the Multi-Step Form
Launch the app using the npm start command.
Complete the multi-step form with your personal and contact information.
If you leave the page or refresh the tab, your data will be saved, and the form will resume from the step you left off.
On submission, a success message will appear with an option to restart the form.
Adding a New Step to the Form
Create a new component (e.g., StepFour.tsx) in the pages/ directory.
Import the new step into the MultiStepForm.tsx component.
Update the steps array with the new step label.
